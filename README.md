# CrankierKit: Another riff on Kirby Plainkit

## Overview

This was a quirky and opinionated version of [Kirby Plainkit](https://GitHub.com/getkirby/plainkit.git). It was intended to be used on shared hosting plans that allow the user to load files _outside_ the public web root directory. It was configured to work on [Siteground](https://siteground.com) hosting out of the box, but can be easily adapted to other hosts. There are no symlinks; the only files in the public web root directory are those that absolutely have to be there. Everything else is safely outside the web server's gaze.

I've moved on to a new hosting platform for my stuff and there's no need for this.  I'm archiving it rather than deleting it because I'm fundamentally a hoarder and there *might be[!!!]** something in here I'll regret deleting even though I have copies elsewhere. 


### So, About Kirby CMS ...

I'm a big fan of [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com). It's a great piece of software backed by a great little company and a community of loyal users. I have no connection with them except as a happily _paying_ customer. **_Kirby is not free software_**. If you're going to use it in a public environment, you **must** buy a license either directly from them or through a Kirby plugin author's website (same price, just helps support the Kirby ecoystem). You can find [everything you'd ever want to know](https://getkirby.com/license) about licensing Kirby on their website.

## Obligatory Disclaimer

This was made for my personal use and I don't have that use anymore.
