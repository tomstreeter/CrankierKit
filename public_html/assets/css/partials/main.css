/**
 *
 * This baseline CSS starter is based extensively on stuff I've learned from:
 *
 * Temani Afif
 * Rachel Andrews,
 * Andy Bell,
 * Stephanie Eckles,
 * Sara Joy
 * Jeremy Keith
 * Eric Meyer
 * Heydon Pickering,
 * Adrian Roselli, though probably not thoroughly enough.
 * Jen Simmons,
 * Jeffery Zeldman
 *
 * The point here is that I didn't make any of this up. I'm stealing from some of the best. Stuff that works is thanks to them. Stuff that's broken is on me.
